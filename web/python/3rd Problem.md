# Game 1!

 **Rock Paper Scissors** is a common game. Let's make a game like it in Python. There will be two players. Ask for player plays (using  `input`), compare them, print out a message of congratulations to the winner, and ask if the players want to start a new game.

 Remember the rules:
- rock beats scissors
- scissors beats paper
- paper beats rock


> Hint :
> - While loops
> - Infinite loops
> - Break statements
