## Your First Blog Site

CRUD application generally means a facility where user of an app can **Create**, **Read**, **Update** and **Delete** data from database

In this challenge you have to build a blog application where:
 - there will be a separate blog page. (`localhost:8000/blogs`) which will display all blogs
 - a write blog page (`localhost:8000/write`) where user can write a blog

It's a challenge where you apply _C=Create_ and _R=Read_. On the later challenges you will face _U=Update_ and _D=Delete_ also.
