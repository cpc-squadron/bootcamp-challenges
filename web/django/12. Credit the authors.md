On the previous blog site challenge you didn't implement login registration. That's why you can't identify who are writing the blogs. Now you have to update your site and add some feature. They are:
  - Authors have to login before they can write blog
  - There will be timestamp
  - Authors can read, write, update, delete a blog
  - Users can only read blog and give like. (You have to count the amount of like)
